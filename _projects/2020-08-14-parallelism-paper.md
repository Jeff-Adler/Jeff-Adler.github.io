<strong>Description:</strong> This paper, published in a top academic Linguistics journal and co-authored with Jesse Zyet, compares <strong>globally optimizing vs locally optimizing</strong> models of language processing (specifically of 'phonological processing'). We begin with a theoretical examination of how the contrasting predications of these algorithms. Then, we provide evidence from languages across the world that only the predictions of the globally optimizing model pans out. We finally discuss implications of these findings for general models of linguistic computation.
