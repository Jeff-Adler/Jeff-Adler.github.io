<strong>Description:</strong> This mobile app allows users to give and receive mentorship. You search for potential mentors through a swipe-based mechanic familiar from dating apps: you specify what type of mentorship you are looking for (Career, Relationship, Self-Esteem), and find users who are older in age and have expertise in that particular domain. You also can accept potential mentees who have requested mentorship from you. Once a user has requested someone's mentorship, and that user has accepted that mentee, they can enter into a livechat. The app is essentially Hinge, but for mentorship.
