<h4>Location:</h4> 

<strong>Brooklyn, NY</strong> 

<h4>Skills:</h4>

<strong>Proficient:</strong> Ruby, Rails, Javascript, React

<strong>Familiar:</strong>  Python, SQL, HTML, CSS

<strong>Additional:</strong>  Spanish, Japanese, Public Speaking, Copywriting, Instructional Design

<h4>Background:</h4>
Code is not written in isolation. The technological specifications, business purpose, and user experience must be 
taken into account. I've had the fortunate opportunity to explore many different roles in my life, all of which have cemented this philosophy!

As a graduate student of Linguistics, I learned to adapt complex algorithms to specific tasks. In this case, to <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11049-020-09478-8">mental models of Natural Language Processing</a>.

As a programmatic ad specialist , I learned the importance of making technology that solves real business problems. By <a href="https://news.semasio.com/market-to-customers-in-their-own-words">applying Natural Language Processing techniques to digital advertising</a>,
we were able to confer values to marketers, by providing  <a href="https://news.semasio.com/helping-marketers-in-the-search-for-significance">reliable methods of predicting consumer behavior</a>.

As a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant, undergraduate Linguistics instructor, and finally, Learning & Development program manager, I 
learned the <a href= "https://www.mediamath.com/blog/growing-the-next-generation-of-talent-to-fuel-a-next-generation-digital-marketing-supply-chain/">design and communication principles</a> necessary to maximally engage and empower a learner or user.

<h4>Interests:</h4>

When I'm not programming, I am likely sipping a coffee in the park, chatting with friends about the relative merits of Goku vs. Superman, or reading! Memorable books include:<br><br>
