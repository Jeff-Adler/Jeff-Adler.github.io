<h4>Location:</h4>

<strong>Brooklyn, NY</strong>

<h4>Email:</h4>

<strong>JeffM.Adler@gmail.com</strong>

<h4>Skills:</h4>

<strong>React | React Native | Redux | JavaScript | Ruby | Rails | SQL | HTML | CSS | Bootstrap | Git | Heroku</strong>

<h4>Background:</h4>

I am a product of my past, and my approach to software development reflects that!

As a programmatic ad specialist , I learned the importance of making technology that solves real business problems. By <a href="https://news.semasio.com/market-to-customers-in-their-own-words">applying Natural Language Processing techniques to digital advertising</a>,
we increased marketers' return on ad spend, by providing <a href="https://news.semasio.com/helping-marketers-in-the-search-for-significance">reliable methods of predicting consumer behavior</a>.

As a graduate student of Linguistics, I learned to appropriately adapt complex algorithms for specific tasks. In this case, to <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11049-020-09478-8">mental models of Natural Language Processing</a>.

As a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant, undergraduate Linguistics instructor, and finally, Learning & Development program manager, I
learned the <a href= "https://www.mediamath.com/blog/growing-the-next-generation-of-talent-to-fuel-a-next-generation-digital-marketing-supply-chain/">design and communication principles</a> necessary to maximize learner and user engagement.
